    "My implementation is relatively simple. The input to the algorithm is the list of all node ids in the largest allied components. Start from a single node, load its enemies into the enemies list and load its allies into a queue that will be processed later. Then we iterate over the allied queue. If a node is not an enemy with any of the existing nodes in the component, add them to the community list and add their enemies to the community’s enemies list. I’ve added some minor performance tweaks like if we have traversed the node already in the allies queue, we can remove that node from the global list of starting nodes."

    "In this code, the algorithm only returns the ids of nodes that belong to the largest allied component where there are no enemies within. It shouldn’t be a problem to mark these nodes in Neo4j, as you can match them by their ids. The largest component of allies, where there are no enemies within, has 142 members. If we visualize it in Neo4j Browser, we can see that there are no enemy relationships visible."

    "## Analyzing characters’ stats\n",
    "In the last part of our analysis, we will examine the stats of the characters. We have the stats available for a total of 470 heroes. This information was scraped from Marvel’s website. The scale for stats ranges from zero to seven, and Iron Man does not have a single seven. Probably not the strongest of the heroes, even though he is one of the more popular ones. Now we will explore the characters with the highest stats average. Whenever I need some help with my cypher queries, I turn to Neo4j Slack. Luckily for us, Andrew Bowman is always around with great advice on optimizing and prettifying our cypher queries. This time he showed me the `apoc.map.values` procedure. It can be used to fetch all properties of a single node without explicitly writing the property keys."

    "The k-Nearest Neighbour is one of the more standard graph algorithms and was already implemented in the Graph Data Science library before in the form of Cosine, Euclidian, and Pearson similarity algorithms. Those were basic implementation where the algorithms compared a given vector for all node pairs in the network. Because comparing all node pairs does not scale well, another implementation of the kNN algorithm was added to the library. It is based on the Efficient k-nearest neighbor graph construction for generic similarity measures article. Instead of comparing every node pair, the algorithm selects possible neighbors based on the assumption that the neighbors-of-neighbors of a node are most likely already the nearest one. The algorithm scales quasi-linear with respect to the node count instead of being quadratic. The implementation uses the Cosine similarity to compare two vectors.\n",
    "First, we need to create a vector (array of numbers) that will be compared between the pairs of heroes. We will use the characters’ stats as well as their ability to fly to populate the vector. Because all stats have the same range between zero and seven, there is no need for normalization. We only need to encode the flight feature to span between zero and seven as well. Those characters that can fly will have the value of flight feature seven, while those who can’t fly will have the value zero."

    "We can notice that the Label Propagation algorithm found twice as many communities as the Louvain Modularity algorithm. Some of them are relatively tiny. For example, the community with an id 693 has only three members, and all their average stats are at 1.0 value. They are the heroes that go by the name of Maggott, Deathbird, and Slayback. Funky names. The most powerful community has an id of 137 and only 23 members. Remember, the most powerful community found by the Louvain Modularity algorithm had 46 members and a slightly lower value of average stats.\n",
